                <p>June 26th, 2022 </p>

            <p>Elko County has more rural communities located in high and extreme wildfire hazard areas than anywhere else in Nevada,
                and the worst hazard potential in the country.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Here many residents and their homes are not prepared to survive wildfire, according to
                <a href="https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=3932">a recent study</a> by the University of Nevada from 2016.
                <br>
                <br>
                More than half of Elko's over 20,600 houses would face a direct exposure to fire in case of an arson, concluded
                the US Department of Agriculture on its <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2020-0016">wildfire risk dataset.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Other risky factors are Elko's vegetation -asagebrush and rabbitbrush- as well as constant summer 
                thunderstorms and dry lightning strikes in the area. <a href="https://www.rci-nv.com/reports/elko/section03.html">Fire records</a>
                show that 64% of prior arsons whose cause was known were due to lightning.</p>
